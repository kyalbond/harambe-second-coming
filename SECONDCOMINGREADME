Running The Game

Step 1: Run the clientserver.Server class as J Application (console will print out the port that is being listened on)
Step 2: Run the gui. 0Menu class as J Application and input a username, address (will be localhost on same machine as server) and port number.

At this point the Main GUI for the game sould have opened and you should be in the game world.

To Move yur Penguin you can use W,A,S,D or click the map within your current or neighbouring location to move by mouse click.

Walking over items will pick them up (floating device, key, teleporter, fish, banana, fishing rod)
Right click items in the inventry to drop them or use/examine them.
You may also right click items/objects on the map to examine the object or the ground beneath them.

Equipping a floaty in the inventory will allow you to swim through water.
Examine a key while its in your inventory to see its code, and right click a chest on the ground to see it's code, if you walk into a chest while holding the key with the same code
you will recieve the contents of the chest (a banana).

If you use a fishing rod will facing a water tile, you will fish and have a chance of catching a fish, if you catch a fish and then take it to an npc you will trade your fish for a banana

Teleporters when used will teleport you back to the spawn location.

Once you have recieved a banana in your inventory, you may right click it and use the siphon option, this will increase you banana count featured below the inventory on the UI.
Once a player has reached 5 bananas the game will end and the name of the winning player will be displayed at the top of the newly created window.

If you walk into the door of a house, you will be transported within the house, if you the walk back onto the doortile (visible from within the house) you will be transported back out of the house.

NPCs will walk around with two possible strategies, talking to them during the day will either result in you getting a banana or no action, at night time the NPCs will become uncontactable and no longer move.

Happy Exploring!!
